#### R Packages

* [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/maptools.pdf): Tools for Reading and Handling Spatial Objects 
* [rgdal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/rgdal.pdf): Bindings for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library 

* [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/raster.pdf): Geographic Data Analysis and Modeling 


We will use **library()** function to load packages in R. We will load three R packages for this lesson

```{r message=F, warning=F}
# Load packages
library(maptools)   # spatial vector data
library (rgdal) 	# Geospatial Data Abstraction Library for spatial data 
library (raster) 	# raster and vector data read & write
```

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>
#### Load Data

We will use following data set and could be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/92r6ot7yujjs9fo/DATA_02.7z?dl=0).  

* New York State county shape file (Polygon: NY_County_GCS) 
* Soil Carbon Data (SOC) from Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and Wyoming (Point: GP_SOC_GCS.shp) 
* Road network maps of Onondaga county, New York State (polyline: "Onondaga_Street_GCS.shp) 
* 90 m SRTM DEM of Onondaga county, New York State (raster: Onondaga_DEM.tif) 
* Landsat8 multibands Images


Before reading the data from a local drive, you need to define a working directory from where you want to read or to write data. We will use **setwd()** function to create a working directory. Or we can define a path for data outside of our working directory from where we can read files. In this case, we will use **paste0(data path, "file name")** 

```{r,eval=F, echo=T}
#### Set working directory
# setwd("~//Read_Write_Spatial_Data")
```

```{r}
# Define data folder
dataFolder<-"D:\\Dropbox\\Spatial Data Analysis and Processing in R\\DATA_02\\DATA_02\\"
```

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">

## Vector Data 

**Vector** data consists of **"geometry"** or **"shape"** of the locations which describe information of spatial objects on earth. There are three types vector data such as  **polygons, points and line or polylines** which  structures of the geometry consists of sets of coordinate pairs (x, y). 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align="center",fig.cap=paste("Vector Data (Source: http://neondataskills.org/GIS-Spatial-Data/Working-With-Rasters/)")} 
knitr::include_graphics('E:\\GitHub\\geospatial-r-github\\Image\\PNG_FILE_02\\vector.png')
```


The **shapefile**, a interchangeably data format which are regulated by [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home). It is one of the most common form of geospatial vector data used in GIS software and analyses. Three unique files are required for a shapefile, including: **.shx** (shape index format; this tags the shapefile with a position, so users can move it forward and backward among layers, a **.shp** (shape format, which stores geometric data, and a **.dbf** (attribute format file; which holds attributes (information) for the shapes in the file). 


In this exercise,  we will  will learn how to read and write **polygons, points and line or polylines** vector data in R. 

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

### Polygons 

Polygons are two-dimensional geographical features covering a portion of the earth's surface, for example, forests, lakes, administrative boundaries, farmers' fields, or any other organizational unit the user defines. Polygons are important because their area and perimeter can be measured.   

#### Read Poylgons

For reading ESRI shape file, we can use  either **readShapePoly()**, **shapefile()**, and **readOGR()** with **maptools**, **raster**, and **rgdal** packages, respectively. Unlike, rgdal or raster packages, the **readShapePoly()** functions neither read [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) information or write projection system. 

```{r}
# Read with maptools
#poly.GCS<-readShapePoly(NY_County_GCS.shp")                      # if data in working directory
poly.GCS<-readShapePoly(paste0(dataFolder, "NY_County_GCS.shp"))  # read polygon data from data path
print(proj4string(poly.GCS))			                                # check projection
```


```{r}
# Read with raster package
poly.GCS<-shapefile(paste0(dataFolder, "NY_County_GCS.shp"))      # read polygon 
print(proj4string(poly.GCS))			                                # check projection
```


```{r}
# Read with rgdal package
dsn="D:\\Dropbox\\Spatial Data Analysis and Processing in R\\DATA_02\\DATA_02"
poly.GCS<- readOGR(dsn=dsn, "NY_County_GCS")   
print(proj4string(poly.GCS))			                                 # check projection
```


If you have set working directory already, no need to define the "dsn" and file extension. Notice that both **shapefile()** and **readOGR()** does not read the **.prj** file, since this file is missing. You can get detail information of vector data with **ogrInfo()** function without loading the data in R.   

```{r}
ogrInfo(dsn =dsn, "NY_County_GCS")
```

You can plot county shape file using **plot()** function.  

```{r,fig.align='center',fig.height=5, fig.width=6}
# Map county shape polygon file
plot(poly.GCS, main="Counties of New York State")
```

#### Write Polygon

We will use  **writeOGR()** function of **rgdal** package or **shapefile()** function of raster package to write the vector data.  

```{r,collapse = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# gdal package  
writeOGR(poly.GCS, 		         # input spatial data
	dsn =dsn,                    # output working directory
	"NY_County_GCS",	           # output spatial data
	driver="ESRI Shapefile",	   # define output file as ESRI shapefile
	overwrite=TRUE)		           # write on existing file, if exist
# raster package
shapefile(poly.GCS, paste0(dataFolder, "NY_County_GCS.shp"), overwrite=TRUE)  
```

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

### Points Vector 

Zero-dimensional points are important for geographical features like wells, soil-sampling locations that can be best expressed by a single reference point. Often point vector data consist off  several points into a multi-point structure, with a single attribute record. For example, all the soil sampling points could be considered as a single geometry. The main drawback of a point feature, however, are that they cannot be used to make measurements (as you can with a polygon).  

We used 650 soil samples from Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and Wyoming. These samples were collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a part of the USGS Geo-chemical Landscapes Project [Smith et al., 2011]. We will use **shapefile()** or **readOGR()** to read this vector data.      

```{r,collapse = TRUE}
# Reading point shape file 
point.GCS<- readOGR(dsn=dsn, "GP_SOC_GCS")                  # with rgdal
# Or
#point.GCS<-shapefile("GP_SOC_GCS.shp")                     # with raster
point.GCS<-shapefile(paste0(dataFolder,"GP_SOC_GCS.shp"))   # with raster
print(proj4string(point.GCS))			                    # check projection                                  
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
# Map point shape file
plot(point.GCS,
     main= "Point Vector map",
     pch=20,   # symbol type
     cex=0.8)  # symbol size
```


We will use  **writeOGR()** function of **rgdal** package or **shapefile()** function of raster package to write the vector data.    

```{r,collapse = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# gdal 
writeOGR(point.GCS, 		      # input spatial data
	dsn=dsn, 			              # output working directory
	"bgs_groundwater",	        # output spatial data
	driver="ESRI Shapefile",	  # define output file as ESRI shapefile
	overwrite=TRUE)		          # write on existing file, if exist
# raster
shapefile(point.GCS, paste0(dataFolder,"GP_SOC_GCS.shp"), overwrite=TRUE)
```

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

### Lines or Polylines     

One-dimensional lines, also called polylines, are used to represent geographical features like rivers, roads, railroads, trails, and topographic lines. Note that these features are linear in nature and do not have area like polygons. Hence, they can measure distance. In this exercise we use road network maps of Onondaga county, New York State. This map can be found [here](https://gis.ny.gov/).     

```{r,collapse = TRUE}
# Read polylines 
#line.GCS<- readOGR(dsn=".", "Ononda_Street_GCS")                    # read polygon
line.GCS<-shapefile(paste0(dataFolder,"Ononda_Street_GCS.shp"))      # with raster
print(proj4string(line.GCS))	
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
# Plot line vactor data
plot(line.GCS, main="Road network in Onondaga County, NY")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:30px;">
</div>

## Raster data    

Unlike vector data, a raster data consists of cells or pixels organized into rows and columns as a matrix where each cell contains a value representing geographical feature on the earth. The size of the area on the surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image. For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area. There are two types of raster data: continuous and discrete.  An example of discrete raster data is Land use raster.  Data types are flexible, including discrete and categorical data, such as soil or land-use maps, or continuous data as in digital elevation models, precipitation gradient maps, or pollutant concentration maps, etc. 



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align="center",fig.cap=paste("Raster Data (Source: http://neondataskills.org/GIS-Spatial-Data/Working-With-Rasters/)")} 
knitr::include_graphics('E:\\GitHub\\geospatial-r-github\\Image\\PNG_FILE_02\\raster.png')
```


Generally, two types of raster use in GIS and remote sensing application:  **a single band**, or layer measure of a single characteristic of spatial area and **multiple bands** raster contains multiple spatially corresponding matrices of cell values representing the same spatial area.  An example of a single-band raster data set is a digital elevation model (DEM). Each cell in a DEM contains only one value representing elevation of earth surface. Most satellite imagery has multiple bands, typically containing values within band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In this exercise, we will use SRTM 90 Digital Elevation Model of Onondaga County, New York State which was downloaded from [CGIAR-CSI](http://www.cgiar-csi.org/data/srtm-90m-digital-elevation-database-v4-1).  

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

### Single band raster 

#### Read raster

**raster()** function of raster package  will use to read the raster data in R

```{r, warning=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
#DEM<-raster("Onondaga_DEM.tif")                     # load raster data with raster package, working directory
DEM<-raster(paste0(dataFolder,"Onondaga_DEM.tif"))   # load raster data with raster package, data folder
print(DEM)                                           # raster Information
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot(DEM, main= "DEM raster")
```

#### Write raster  

Now we will write DEM data using **writeRaster()** function of raster package  

```{r,  eval=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Write raster
writeRaster(DEM,                             # Input raster
            paste0(dataFolder,"DEM.tif"),    # output raster in data folder
            "GTiff",                         # output raster file extension
            overwrite=TRUE)                  # write on existing file, if exist 
```

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

### Multi-bands raster  

For loading multi-bands image in R, we will use a sub-set of Landsat 8 multispectral image covering Onondaga county of New York state. This image was downloaded from [USGS Earth Explore]( http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ ). You can read single band image one by one with **raster()** function.  

```{r,results='hide'}
# read band 2 (Blue band)
b2<-raster(paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\LC08_L1TP_015030_20150716_20170226_01_T1_B2.TIF"))
# read band 3 (Green band)
b3<-raster(paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\LC08_L1TP_015030_20150716_20170226_01_T1_B3.TIF"))
# read band 4 (Red band)
b4<-raster(paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\LC08_L1TP_015030_20150716_20170226_01_T1_B4.TIF"))
# read band 4 (NIR band)
b5<-raster(paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\LC08_L1TP_015030_20150716_20170226_01_T1_B5.TIF"))
```

Now, you can use **stack()** or **brick()** function to create multi-band raster stack. We will discuss detail in Lesson 4. 

```{r}
# Stack all raster
multi_band<-stack(b2,b3,b4,b5)
```

OR you can create  a list of raster layers to use (for example bands 2 to 5) first then use *stack()* function to raster list read all several raster   

```{r}
bandList <- paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\LC08_L1TP_015030_20150716_20170226_01_T1_B", 2:5, ".tif")
bandList
multi_band <- stack(bandList)
multi_band
```

Use simple plot function to map all raster in raster stack

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width = 7.5}
# Plot all raster in raster stack
# Rename the raster bands in raster stack
names(multi_band) <- c("B2", "B3", "B4", "B5")
plot(multi_band, main="Blue, Green, Red & NIR bands of Landsat 8")
```

We use same ##writeRaster()** function to write raster stack of 5 bands as a composite band (multi-band)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#writeRaster(multi_band, ".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\multi_band.tif", overwrite=TRUE)
writeRaster(multi_band, paste0(dataFolder,".\\LC08_20150706_subset\\multi_band.tif"), overwrite=TRUE)
```


```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```
