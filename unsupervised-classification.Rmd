In this lesson we will learn how to do Unsupervised classification in R.  We will use a sub-set of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images covering the North Campus of the University at Buffalo (UB), New York. We will use the **unsuperClass()** function of the RSToolbox package to run unsupervised classification with 5 classes. Here clustering is done using **kmeans** which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.  


#### Load package

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library (raster) 	  # raster data
library(rasterVis)	# raster visualisation 	
library(sp)         # Spatial data processing			
library(rgdal)      # Spatial data processing
library(RStoolbox)  # Image analysis
library(ggplot2)    # ploting
```

The data could be available for download from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ybh1kr487wrhl8i/DATA_09.7z?dl=0).

<div style="margin-bottom:20px;">
</div>

```{r}
# Define data folder
dataFolder<-"F://Spatial_Data_Processing_and_Analysis_R//Data//DATA_09//"
```


#### Load bands

```{r}
#s=stack(BLUE, GREEN, RED, NIR,SWIR1,SWIR2)
multi=stack(paste0(dataFolder,".\\Sentinel_2\\multi_bands.tif"))
```

### K-means clusstering for unsupervised classification

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).

```{r}
set.seed(25)
unC_05 <- unsuperClass(multi,	# raster stack
	nSamples = 100,	            # Number of random samples to draw to fit cluster map 
	nClasses= 5,		            # Number of classes	 
	nStarts = 5)		            # Number of random starts for kmeans algorithm.
```

#### Plot map:

```{r,echo=TRUE,fig.align='center',fig.height=5, fig.width=6.5,message=F, warning=F}
myPalette <- colorRampPalette(c("white","dark grey", "darkgreen","green", "light blue"))
spplot(unC_05$map, main="Unsupervised Classificantion, No.class= 5" , 
      colorkey = list(space="right",tick.number=1,height=1, width=1.5,
              labels = list(at = seq(1,4.8,length=5),cex=1.0,
              lab = c("Class-1" ,"Class-2", "Class-3", "Class-4", "Class-5"))),
              col.regions=myPalette,cut=4)
```

#### Write raster

```{r}
# writeRaster(unC_05$map, filename=paste0(dataFolder,".\\Sentinel_2\\K_mean_UnSuper.tif"), format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE)
```
