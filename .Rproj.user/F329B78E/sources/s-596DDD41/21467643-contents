title: "Spatial Autocorrelation"
---


Spatial autocorrelation measures the degree of correlation to itself through space (Cliff and Ord 1973, 1981). Tests of spatial autocorrelation examine the independency of observed value of a variable in relation to values of that variable at neighboring locations. Spatial autocorrelation can be positive or negative.

**Positive spatial autocorrelation** indicates that similar values appear close to each other, or cluster, in space. 

**Negative spatial autocorrelation** occurs when dissimilar values occur near one another. 

**Null spatial autocorrelation** indicates that the spatial pattern is random. 

Classic spatial autocorrelation statistics include:

* Moran's I , 

* Geary's C , 

* Getis's G  

* standard deviational ellipse
