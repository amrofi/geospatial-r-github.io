**What is R?** 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source environment for statistical computing and visualization. It is based on the S language developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1980's, and is the product of an active movement among statisticians for a powerful, programmable, portable, and open computing environment, applicable to the most complex and sophisticated problems, as well as "routine" analysis, without any restrictions on access or use.

**Download and Installation R**

The R can download from the [R project](www.r-project.org ) of a repository CRAN or you can install [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/download). Detail Installation steps of Microsoft R Open in different operating systems can be found [here](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/installation).   


**Download and Installation R-Studio**

[RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Click here to see more RStudio features.RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux)](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

First, you have to download RStudio according to your operating system from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) 
For windows user, and just run the installation file and it normally detects your latest installed R version automatically. If you want to do some extra configuration, you need follow  some steps which can be found [here](http://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-install-and-configure-rstudio/)

For Linux user, use following commands in terminal:

* $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
* $ wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.383-amd64.deb
* $ sudo gdebi rstudio-xenial-1.1.383-amd64
* $ rm rstudio-xenial-1.1.383-amd64



**R Packages** 

Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library. For this training, we need several R-packages.

**Installation of R-packages** 

If the R program has already been installed, the installation of any 'package' can be done directly from the console of R through internet or from local drive. It is better to install through the internet. Detail installation steps can be found [here](http://jtleek.com/modules/01_DataScientistToolbox/02_09_installingRPackages/#7)
